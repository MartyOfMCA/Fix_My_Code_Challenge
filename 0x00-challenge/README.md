# 0x00. Fix my code
This project aims at debugging code implementations to first and foremost find all bugs. The code implementations are modified to provide the right implementation and desired output (wherever possible).

This directory contains source code files on a challange with the purpose of fixing some code implementations.

This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX. Here is a [Link](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) to the original repo with code implementations with bugs.
